# Game-AJ
game

Current work in progress.

This project is a collaboration between Aaron and Justin (AJ).
Justin will write most of the game's logic, while Aaron will be writing most of the graphical parts of it. 

This will likely be a rogue-like dungeon kinda game. 
This makes it easy to control the camera, and have the actual objects move relative to the absolute location of the screen. 
Because we are lazy.
